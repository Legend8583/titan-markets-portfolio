    <!-- Opening -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>📌 Opening</h2>
      <p>
        Pokémon cards are rarely viewed through an investment lens. Individual cards are low-ticket,
        price discovery is slow, and liquidity is uneven. There is no earnings calendar, no macro release,
        and no real-time order book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet over long horizons, Pokémon cards have exhibited a return profile that is quietly resilient.
        Appreciation is not explosive, but it is persistent. For me, the appeal has never been about
        short-term speculation. It is about owning culturally durable assets in a market where patience,
        selection, and execution matter more than speed.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Core premise:</strong>
        Pokémon cards are not a trading vehicle. They are a slow, condition-sensitive asset class
        where long-term compounding is driven by scarcity and sustained demand.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Why Pokémon -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌍 Why Pokémon (IP First, Cards Second)</h2>
      <p>
        My conviction in Pokémon cards starts with the intellectual property itself.
        Pokémon is consistently ranked as the largest and most successful media franchise globally.
        That scale matters because it creates something rare in collectibles: deep, global demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        For physical collectibles, the most important moat is not innovation or exclusivity,
        but market depth. Pokémon’s multi-generational audience and continuous product cycle
        significantly reduce the risk of permanent demand loss.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Global collector base across regions and age groups</li>
        <li>Highly active secondary markets</li>
        <li>Ongoing cultural reinforcement through games, media, and licensing</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Implication:</strong>
        Market depth does not guarantee upside, but it materially improves long-term liquidity
        and exit optionality.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Entry Point -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧭 My Entry Point and Time Horizon</h2>
      <p>
        I began collecting Pokémon cards in early 2016, around the 20th Anniversary period.
        The decision was not driven by price momentum or speculative demand.
        At the time, Pokémon had already proven its cultural permanence.
      </p>
      <p>
        That timing mattered. I was entering a market where relevance was established,
        but pricing was still far from saturated. My holding horizon has always been measured
        in years rather than months.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Portfolio Structure -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧺 Portfolio Structure</h2>
      <p>
        My Pokémon exposure is intentionally diversified by format.
        Each category serves a different role in the portfolio.
      </p>

      <h3>Sealed Products</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Low turnover, long-horizon exposure</li>
        <li>Supply naturally tightens over time</li>
        <li>Liquidity is limited, position sizing must be conservative</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Singles (Core Allocation)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary source of flexibility and liquidity</li>
        <li>Pricing is more transparent than sealed</li>
        <li>Many positions originate from self-opened products</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Graded Cards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Smaller in count, larger in value</li>
        <li>Used selectively for high-demand cards</li>
        <li>Primarily a liquidity and condition-certainty tool</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Selection Framework -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧠 Card Selection Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, I have found that card performance is consistently driven by three variables:
        demand, scarcity, and condition.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Demand</h3>
      <p>
        Demand is the foundation. Cards tied to universally recognized characters
        tend to retain liquidity across cycles.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Scarcity</h3>
      <p>
        Scarcity operates at multiple levels: print runs, pull rates, and surviving population.
        Lower supply amplifies price response once demand re-emerges.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Condition</h3>
      <p>
        Condition is the multiplier. Two identical cards can diverge significantly in value
        depending on preservation and centering.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong>
        Demand determines liquidity, scarcity determines upside, and condition determines
        whether that upside is realized.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Method Checklist -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧾 My Pre-Purchase Checklist</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Is long-term demand structurally intact?</li>
        <li>Is current pricing driven by hype or stability?</li>
        <li>How many comparable listings exist?</li>
        <li>Is condition clearly above average?</li>
        <li>Does grading add asymmetrical upside?</li>
        <li>Am I comfortable holding through a down cycle?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Grading Rubric -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>📑 Grading Decision Rubric</h2>
      <p>
        Grading is optionality, not certainty. I only grade when the quality margin
        meaningfully outweighs grading risk.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear centering and clean edges</li>
        <li>Minimal surface defects under light</li>
        <li>High demand card where top grades command liquidity premium</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="risk-box">
        Grading at peak hype or with marginal condition often results in poor risk-adjusted outcomes.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Risks -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>⚠️ Risks & Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Pokémon cards are not immune to cycles. The most common mistakes arise from timing,
        not card quality.
      </p>

      <h3>Hype Cycles</h3>
      <p>
        Newly released sets experience unstable pricing.
        Waiting for supply and sentiment to normalize reduces downside risk.
      </p>

      <h3>Peak Attention Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Buying at maximum attention increases drawdown probability.
        The best entries tend to occur before or after peak hype.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong>
        Poor timing can overwhelm good selection.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>✅ Closing Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Pokémon cards have taught me that patience itself can be a form of edge.
        In a market defined by friction and cultural attachment,
        disciplined selection and long-term thinking matter more than speed.
