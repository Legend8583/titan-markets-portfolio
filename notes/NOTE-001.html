    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧭 Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This note explains how Chinese companies listed in the U.S. can build momentum through a repeated pattern:
        narrative acceptance, capital access, and staged capital rotation. It is written from a trader’s perspective,
        grounded in firsthand participation across multiple China ADR cycles.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key idea:</strong> Momentum tends to emerge when a story becomes <em>investable</em> and broadly accepted.
        Once the narrative is established, capital often rotates from anchor names into sector leaders and then into
        smaller “catch-up” names.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase I -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>⚡ Phase I — The Chinese EV Narrative</h2>

      <p>
        My first meaningful exposure to U.S.-listed Chinese equities came through the EV wave. Around 2020, the market
        began treating China EV as a sector-level growth theme rather than a single-company bet. While NIO listed earlier,
        XPeng and Li Auto going public in the second half of 2020 helped reinforce the idea that this was an investable
        category with multiple credible players.
      </p>

      <p>
        The narrative was simple and easy to spread: EVs were still novel to many retail investors, China was viewed as the
        world’s most important auto market, and the “growth optionality” felt large. Early participation was further supported
        by the perception that these companies were real operators investing heavily in product development and technology,
        even if profitability was not immediate.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase II -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧱 Phase II — Alibaba as the Anchor Asset</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike the EV names, Alibaba functioned less as a new story and more as a core Chinese internet asset — an implicit
        anchor for China-related positioning in U.S. markets. Its scale, liquidity, and recurring earnings-driven volatility
        made it a natural reference point for investors expressing a view on Chinese consumer internet exposure.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a trading perspective, the importance of an anchor asset is not whether it is always trending up, but whether it
        remains continuously “in play.” Alibaba’s sustained attention helped stabilize the broader narrative environment and
        provided a foundation for spillover into smaller, more thematic names.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase III -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌊 Phase III — Narrative Spillover into Sector Leaders</h2>

      <p>
        As interest in China risk returns, capital often looks for the next expression of the theme beyond the most established
        names. However, rotation is not purely mechanical: capital still needs “fundamental permission” — a credible real-world
        backdrop — to justify moving into the next layer of stocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        KE Holdings is a good example of this A+B dynamic. Spillover happens because investors are looking for China exposure,
        but it becomes tradable when there is a supportive backdrop. As property-related regulations were gradually optimized
        and expectations for transaction stabilization improved, KE could be framed as a sector leader benefiting from valuation
        repair rather than a company-specific miracle.
      </p>

      <p>
        A similar pattern can show up in other well-known, liquid sector representatives such as Bilibili: once the broader narrative
        is re-established, familiar names become natural recipients of incremental flows.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- What I learned -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧠 What I Learned as a Trader</h2>

      <h3>Leader confirmation → catch-up opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        Returns often come not only from following the headline leader, but from understanding how capital propagates within a sector.
        When a clear leader starts moving, I watch for delayed spillover into smaller, lagging names within the same industry.
        That short lag can create a narrow but actionable window for decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when KE Holdings rallied, I also monitored smaller-cap peers such as Fangdd Network Group (DUO) as a potential
        catch-up expression of the same real estate theme.
      </p>

      <h3>Participation discipline matters more than activity</h3>
      <p>
        I avoid trades when the story feels detached from any reasonable support, or when I cannot clearly explain why incremental
        capital should keep flowing into the theme. A practical risk signal is sentiment saturation: when a topic becomes widely
        discussed by participants with limited market context, positioning is often already crowded.
      </p>

      <p>
        My preference is to participate during the early or middle stages of a narrative cycle — when attention is building but the
        trade has not become purely reflexive — and to step aside once the story becomes too popular or difficult to justify.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>✅ Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Chinese ADR momentum on Wall Street is rarely just a function of earnings or valuation. It tends to emerge when a narrative becomes
        investable, capital access reinforces legitimacy, and rotation spreads the theme across sectors. For traders, the edge is less about
        predicting the next headline and more about recognizing where the market sits in the narrative cycle — before participation becomes crowded.
