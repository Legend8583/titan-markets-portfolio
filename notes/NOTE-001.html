    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧭 Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This note outlines a repeatable pattern for how China-related equities can build momentum in U.S. markets:
        <strong>narrative acceptance</strong> → <strong>capital access</strong> → <strong>staged capital rotation</strong>.
        It is written from a trader’s perspective, grounded in firsthand participation across multiple China ADR cycles.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin: 0 0 10px;">
          <strong>Scope:</strong> This note focuses on <em>market narrative mechanics</em> (how flows move and how participation expands),
          not a fundamental valuation call on any single company.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
          <strong>Personal anchor:</strong> My first China ADR trade was <strong>NIO</strong> in <strong>Nov 2020</strong>,
          which shaped how I recognize narrative cycles in real time.

          A theme becomes tradable when it is <strong>easy to understand</strong>, <strong>liquid enough to express</strong>,
          and <strong>early enough that positioning is not yet saturated</strong>.

    <!-- Phase I -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>⚡ Phase I — The Chinese EV Narrative</h2>

      <p>
        The early China ADR momentum I experienced was tied to the EV wave. Around 2020, the market began treating
        China EV as a sector-level growth theme rather than a single-company bet. Multiple listings and the emergence
        of credible “category leaders” helped reinforce the idea that this was an investable category that U.S. capital
        could access and scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story was also easy to spread. EVs were still relatively novel to many retail investors, China was widely viewed
        as the world’s most important auto market, and the perceived upside felt large. Early participation was further supported
        by the perception that these companies were real operators investing heavily in product development and technology, even
        if profitability was not immediate.
      </p>

      <div class="checklist">
        <div class="checklist-title">Phase I signals</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Clustered listings / sector visibility increases (theme becomes “investable”)</li>
          <li>Retail-friendly narrative (large TAM, simple story, easy comps)</li>
          <li>Liquidity improves and participation broadens beyond a single ticker</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase II -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧱 Phase II — Alibaba as the Anchor Asset</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike the EV names, <strong>Alibaba(BABA)</strong> functioned less as a new story and more as a core Chinese internet asset —
        an implicit anchor for China-related positioning in U.S. markets. Its scale, liquidity, and recurring earnings-driven
        volatility made it a natural reference point for investors expressing a view on Chinese consumer internet exposure.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a trading perspective, the importance of an anchor asset is not whether it is always trending up, but whether it remains
        continuously “in play.” Regular earnings cycles provide repeated moments for re-pricing and re-positioning, which helps keep the
        broader narrative environment active even outside peak hype windows.
      </p>

      <div class="checklist">
        <div class="checklist-title">Phase II signals</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Anchor liquidity and institutional “default expression” of the theme</li>
          <li>Earnings rhythm becomes a recurring volatility catalyst</li>
          <li>Theme cohesion: other names start reacting to anchor sentiment</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase III -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌊 Phase III — Narrative Spillover into Sector Leaders</h2>

      <p>
        As interest in China risk returns, capital often searches for additional expressions beyond the most established names.
        However, spillover is rarely automatic. Rotation typically requires <strong>fundamental permission</strong> — a credible real-world
        backdrop that makes the next layer of stocks defensible, not just tradable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>KE Holdings (BEKE)</strong> illustrates this A+B dynamic. Investors may look for “the next China vehicle,” but the move tends to
        be more durable when the policy tone is <em>incrementally more supportive (or less restrictive)</em> and expectations for stabilization
        improve. In that environment, a sector leader can be framed as a valuation repair candidate rather than a pure narrative momentum play.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar spillover can show up in other well-known, liquid sector representatives such as <strong>Bilibili (BILI)</strong> once the broader
        narrative is re-established. At that point, incremental flows often rotate into familiar names with liquidity, visibility, and a story
        that fits the moment.
      </p>

      <div class="checklist">
        <div class="checklist-title">Phase III signals</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Policy / macro backdrop provides “permission” for re-engagement</li>
          <li>Leaders receive the first bid; second-tier names react with a lag</li>
          <li>Move is framed as valuation repair and positioning normalization</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- What I learned -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧠 What I Learned as a Trader</h2>

      <h3>Leader confirmation → catch-up opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        Returns often come not only from following the headline leader, but from understanding how capital propagates within a sector.
        When a clear leader starts moving, I watch for delayed spillover into smaller, lagging names within the same industry.
        That short lag can create a narrow but actionable window for decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, when BEKE rallied, I also monitored smaller-cap peers such as <strong>Fangdd Network Group (DUO)</strong> as a potential
        catch-up expression of the same real estate theme.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h3>Risk is different in secondary names</h3>
      <p>
        I size secondary/laggard expressions more conservatively and manage them more tactically.
        They can mean-revert violently if the narrative stalls, so I tend to take profits faster and keep invalidation rules tighter.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h3>Participation discipline matters more than activity</h3>
      <p>
        I avoid trades when the story feels detached from any reasonable support, or when I cannot clearly explain why incremental
        capital should keep flowing into the theme. A practical risk signal is sentiment saturation: when a topic becomes widely discussed
        by participants with limited market context, positioning is often already crowded.
      </p>

      <p>
        My preference is to participate during the early or middle stages of a narrative cycle — when attention is building but the
        trade has not become purely reflexive — and to step aside once the story becomes too popular or difficult to justify.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>✅ Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Chinese ADR momentum on Wall Street is rarely just a function of earnings or valuation. It tends to emerge when a narrative becomes
        investable, capital access reinforces legitimacy, and rotation spreads the theme across sectors. For traders, the edge is less about
        predicting the next headline and more about recognizing where the market sits in the narrative cycle — before participation becomes crowded.

        This note intentionally avoids heavy data tables. If you want to validate or expand the framework, these are the most useful items to
        cross-check (high-level, not exhaustive):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IPO / listing timeline milestones for major China ADRs (EV wave and platform names)</li>
        <li>China ADR regulatory headline timeline (risk premium changes and sentiment regime shifts)</li>
        <li>Property policy tone timeline (supportive vs restrictive framing) and transaction activity indicators</li>
        <li>ETF / index exposure changes that can amplify theme flows (where relevant)</li>
