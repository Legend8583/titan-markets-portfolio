    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>📌 Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Memecoins are often dismissed as "worthless," and in the traditional valuation sense, that critique is fair.
        But "no intrinsic value" does not mean "no tradable structure." In practice, memecoins are reflexive markets
        where attention, liquidity, and positioning can dominate price discovery.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Treat memecoins as <em>attention + liquidity instruments</em>, not as
        discounted cash flow assets. Your edge comes from execution, timing, and understanding who you're trading against.
      </div>

      <p>
        This note connects memecoin trading back to concepts that exist in any market: order flow, crowd behavior,
        narrative propagation, and disciplined risk management. I use the Trump coin launch (January 17, 2025) as a case study.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Why I Was Ready -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧭 Why I Stayed Out — But Stayed Ready</h2>
      <p>
        I did not participate in earlier "easy money" memecoin phases (e.g., the 2021 Dogecoin mania or the 2024
        re-acceleration in Solana meme activity). But staying out of a trade does not mean ignoring a market.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal was simple: if a rare opportunity appears, I want the ability to execute immediately. That meant keeping
        basic on-chain infrastructure ready even when I wasn't actively trading memes: wallets set up, access tested,
        and operational steps rehearsed. In memecoins, opportunity windows are often measured in minutes.
      </p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p class="q">"I can sit out the game, but I don't want to show up unprepared when the best pitch comes."</p>
        <p class="a">Preparation is part of edge in markets where timing matters more than "being right."</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- What Memecoins Actually Are -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧩 Not All Memecoins Are the Same</h2>
      <p>
        Treating all memecoins as one asset class is a fast way to lose money. I bucket memecoins into three practical types:
      </p>

      <h3>1) Project-Linked Tokens</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Closer to early-stage venture-style bets (team, roadmap, distribution, token mechanics)</li>
        <li>Edge is research and identifying real user adoption vs. noise</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Celebrity / Event-Driven Tokens</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pure attention and narrative trades (timing, distribution, legitimacy, and liquidity)</li>
        <li>Valuation is not the driver; reflexivity is</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Pure Memes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No "meaning" beyond the meme; price is crowd coordination</li>
        <li>Edge is microstructure + risk control, not fundamentals</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Practical takeaway:</strong> The category determines the playbook. Don't use one strategy for all three.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Where Edge Comes From -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>⚙️ Where Edge Comes From in Meme Markets</h2>
      <p>
        Many memecoin participants lose money because they treat the market like a lottery. I view it as a faster,
        noisier version of the same game: informed capital vs. emotional capital.
      </p>

      <h3>Information & Microstructure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distribution and flow:</strong> who is buying, how liquidity is forming, and where attention is concentrated</li>
        <li><strong>Wallet and venue awareness:</strong> execution quality differs across on-chain vs. exchange venues</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative propagation:</strong> how quickly a story spreads matters as much as the story itself</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When Technicals Start to Matter</h3>
      <p>
        In very small tokens, "technicals" are often meaningless because liquidity is thin. But once liquidity becomes
        real (for example, after a token reaches a more established regime with thicker order flow), technical planning
        becomes more useful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>After the first wave of FOMO, early winners take profit</li>
        <li>New entrants buy the story later, creating predictable consolidation patterns</li>
        <li>Support/resistance and risk–reward mapping can reduce emotional decision-making</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- My Preferred Approach -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>📈 My Preferred Playbook: Large Size, Small Moves</h2>
      <p>
        The most common memecoin style is "small capital, huge percentage returns." That can work, but the path risk is high.
        My most consistent approach has been the opposite: focus on more established, higher-liquidity memecoins and capture
        smaller, repeatable swings with larger position size.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Capital efficiency principle:</strong> a +100% move on $1,000 and a +10% move on $10,000 produce the same P&L.
        The difference is survivability, execution, and repeatability.
      </div>

      <p>
        In a chaotic market, I prefer the approach that is more durable. I'm not trying to "win the lottery."
        I'm trying to compound without blowing up.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Trump Coin Case Study -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🧾 Case Study: The Trump Coin Trade (January 2025)</h2>

      <h3>Why I Treated the Signal as Real</h3>
      <p>
        The launch signal came from the official Trump Twitter account. Given the reputational risk of a compromised account
        at that visibility, I judged the probability of a hack or misinformation to be low. In celebrity-driven meme trades,
        legitimacy in the first minutes can matter more than "valuation."
      </p>

      <h3>Execution: Entry Structure Across Venues</h3>
      <p>
        I mobilized idle capital quickly and executed across two venues with different advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phantom (on-chain):</strong> earlier access during initial liquidity formation</li>
        <li><strong>OKX (exchange):</strong> deeper liquidity and smoother fills once volume expanded</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="code-block">Launch Date: 2025-01-17
Early Entries (Phantom): ~$4–$7
Full Position Built: ~$13–$21 (liquidity expansion phase)
Execution Notes: staged entries to reduce slippage + operational risk</div>

      <h3>Exit Discipline: Selling Strength, Not Headlines</h3>
      <p>
        As the trade matured, retail attention anchored on round-number targets (many were focused on $100). My experience
        with speculative assets is that first-cycle hype rarely resolves cleanly at obvious psychological levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        When price first pushed toward the ~$80 area, momentum began to weaken. After a pullback into the ~$55–$65 zone,
        I re-added a small amount tactically. The entire position was ultimately exited around ~$73, prioritizing realized gains
        over headline-driven optimism.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Intent:</strong> I wasn't trying to capture the absolute top. I wanted to exit while momentum was still favorable
        and liquidity was abundant.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Risk Management -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🛡️ Risk Rules (Non-Negotiables)</h2>

      <div class="risk-box">
        <strong>Core rule:</strong> If Bitcoin / the broader tape is weak, I avoid memecoins. In meme markets, downside is not
        just "large" — it can be terminal.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycle awareness:</strong> memecoin participation is opportunistic, not permanent</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity first:</strong> prioritize venues and sizing that allow clean exits</li>
        <li><strong>No hero holds:</strong> don't turn a tactical trade into a belief system</li>
        <li><strong>Respect zero risk:</strong> a token can go from "strong" to effectively zero very quickly</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>✅ Closing Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Memecoins are not value assets:</strong> they are attention + liquidity instruments</li>
        <li><strong>Edge is operational:</strong> preparation, execution, timing, and discipline</li>
        <li><strong>Structure exists:</strong> once liquidity is real, technical planning can reduce emotional trading</li>
        <li><strong>Risk is asymmetric:</strong> when the macro tape is bad, memes are the first place risk gets punished</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>My view:</strong> Web3 markets are not "worse" markets. They're faster, noisier, and less forgiving —
        but the underlying game is still positioning vs. emotion.
